# UArizona Data Lab Workshops - Spring 2024

## Intro to Classical Machine Learning

### Mastering Machine Learning: Your Path to Data-Driven Research

"Mastering Machine Learning: Your Path to Data-Driven Research” covers essential concepts in classical machine learning, offered with beginner-friendly, hands-on programming demonstration in Python. We focus on one key algorithm, statistical concept, or tool each week and offer a real-world, hands-on data science application. 

Dive into the tools and concepts you need to choose, design, and deploy ML models. Brush up on the fundamentals of big data analysis, and access our fantastic resources!
